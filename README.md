# 🚗 Vehicle Detection and Tracking

A real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and counting system built using **YOLOv11**, designed to count vehicles moving in different directions by detecting when they cross predefined virtual lines. This project is suitable for traffic analysis, smart city applications, and surveillance systems.

## Demo:
Below is an example frame from the processed video:
- Vehicles moving upward cross the red line
- Vehicles moving downward cross the yellow line
